# Bigdata_Project

ABSTRACT:-
The coronavirus pandemic has left national economies and businesses counting the costs with governments struggling to come up with measures and policies to tackle the spread of the virus. In this project we try to unfold the effects caused by the pandemic mainly on the US economy and try to explain a few trends and patterns observed on certain economic factors alongside the patterns observed in countries like India, China, Italy and Spain on the same factors. We try to explicate these trends with real life events such as strategies and policies that the corresponding governments came up with at the time and how these events affected society and in turn helped to shape the pandemic.
